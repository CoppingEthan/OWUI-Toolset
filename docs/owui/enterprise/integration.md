# Integration

### Make Open WebUI Your Own​

Off-the-shelf software rarely fits enterprise workflows perfectly. Teams have established processes, specific model requirements, and brand standards that generic tools can't accommodate.

Open WebUI is built differently. From the interface your users see to the AI models powering their work, every layer is designed for customization, without requiring you to fork the codebase or maintain a separate build.

### AI Model Integration​

#### Connect Any Model to Any Workflow​

Your organization's AI needs are unique. Maybe you have fine-tuned models on proprietary data. Perhaps you are committed to specific providers for compliance reasons. Or you need different models for different use cases across departments.

Open WebUI supports flexible model integration:

  * **Proprietary Models** , Connect models you have developed or fine-tuned specifically for your organization's domain.
  * **Third-Party Providers** , Integrate commercial AI services that meet your compliance and performance requirements.
  * **Local Models** , Run models entirely on-premise for maximum data control and reduced latency.
  * **Multi-Model Environments** , Offer different models to different teams, or build multi-model agentic workflows based on specific needs.



#### Model Optimization for Enterprise Workflows​

Beyond basic connectivity, Open WebUI's enterprise offerings include guidance on optimizing model performance for your specific use cases:

  * **Fine-Tuning Consultation** , Work with our team to optimize models for your domain vocabulary and use patterns.
  * **Performance Benchmarking** , Understand how different models perform against your actual workflow requirements.
  * **Cost Optimization** , Balance model capability against token costs for sustainable deployment at scale.



### Extensibility & Platform Integration​

#### Built to Extend, Not Replace​

Enterprise software ecosystems are complex. The last thing you need is another silo. Open WebUI's modular architecture means it works _with_ your existing infrastructure, not against it:

Integration Type| Examples  
---|---  
**Identity Systems**|  LDAP, Active Directory, SSO providers (SAML, OIDC).  
**Enterprise Tools**|  Connect to internal APIs, databases, and business systems.  
**Workflow Automation**|  Integrate with existing automation pipelines and orchestration tools.  
**Observability**|  Feed logs and metrics into your existing monitoring stack.  
  
#### Extend Without Forking​

Open WebUI's plugin and pipeline architecture allows you to add functionality without modifying core code:

  * **Custom Workflows** , Build organization-specific AI workflows that reflect your actual business processes.
  * **Data Connectors** , Create integrations that pull context from your internal knowledge bases.
  * **Specialized Interfaces** , Develop custom UI components for specific departmental needs.
  * **Automation Hooks** , Trigger actions in external systems based on AI interactions.
