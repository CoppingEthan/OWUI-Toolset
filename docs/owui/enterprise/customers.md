## Powering Innovation at Scale​

Open WebUI is the interface of choice for individuals, engineering teams, researchers, and enterprises worldwide. With thousands of active deployments, it powers AI initiatives across startups, Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and research institutions, helping people reclaim time for what truly matters.

Many of our users work in environments where privacy isn't optional, it's essential. That's by design. Open WebUI is built for those who need powerful AI capabilities with complete control over their data.
