# Title: Align .env.example and README configuration tables

## Issue Summary
Full audit of all environment variables revealed mismatches between `.env.example`, `README.md`, and actual usage in code. Five variables listed in both files were never read from `process.env` — they only work as pipeline valves in `owui-pipe.py`. Six variables that ARE read from `process.env` were missing from the README. One default value was wrong.

## Old Behaviour
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `COMFYUI_BASE_URL` were listed in `.env.example` and README, implying they could be set server-side. In reality the server never reads these from `process.env` — they arrive in the request body from `owui-pipe.py` valves (`config.openai_api_key`, `config.tavily_api_key`, etc.).
- `HOST`, `DATABASE_PATH`, `ANTHROPIC_MAX_TOKENS`, `COMPACTION_MAX_SUMMARY_TOKENS`, `ALLOW_REMOTE_UPGRADE`, `DEBUG_MODE` were in `.env.example` but missing from the README table.
- `COMPACTION_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` documented as default `0` in README, but `src/api/server.js:1485` defaults to `65536`.

## New Behaviour
- Removed the 5 pipeline-only variables from `.env.example` and README. Added a note in both files explaining that LLM keys and tool service URLs are set as pipeline valves in Open WebUI.
- Added all 6 missing variables to the README table with accurate descriptions and defaults.
- Fixed `COMPACTION_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` default to `65536` in both files.
- README table and `.env.example` now list the same 20 server-side variables and are fully aligned.

## Files Changed
- **README.md** (lines 46–67) — Rewrote the Configuration table: removed 5 pipeline-only rows, added 6 missing rows (`HOST`, `DATABASE_PATH`, `ANTHROPIC_MAX_TOKENS`, `COMPACTION_MAX_SUMMARY_TOKENS`, `ALLOW_REMOTE_UPGRADE`, `DEBUG_MODE`), fixed `COMPACTION_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` default from `0` to `65536`, added note about pipeline valves.
- **.env.example** (full rewrite) — Removed `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `COMFYUI_BASE_URL` sections. Added header note about pipeline valves. Fixed `COMPACTION_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` commented default from `0` to `65536`.

## Key Design Decisions
- **DOCLING_BASE_URL stays** in `.env.example` because `src/cee/handlers/docling-handler.js:8` reads it from `process.env`. It's also a pipeline valve, but the server-side read is the primary usage for the CEE handler.
- **Pipeline valve variables removed** rather than kept with a "not used here" comment, to avoid confusion. The note at the top of `.env.example` and in the README table directs users to configure these in Open WebUI instead.
- **COMPACTION_TOKEN_THRESHOLD default corrected** to match `src/api/server.js:1485` (`65536`), which means compaction is enabled by default when the env var is unset.
