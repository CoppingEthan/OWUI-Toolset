# Scratchpad

Development log for the OWUI Toolset project. Each entry documents a change, bug fix, or notable decision.

## Writing an Entry

1. Create a new file in this folder named with the date and time: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.md`
2. Use the following structure:

```
# Title: Short description of the change

## Issue Summary
What was the problem or what feature was added.

## Root Cause (for bug fixes)
Why the issue was happening.

## Old Behaviour
What happened before the change.

## New Behaviour
What happens after the change.

## Files Changed
List each file with a short description of what changed and which lines were affected.

## Key Design Decisions
Why things were done a particular way — useful context for future reference.
```

3. Keep entries factual and concise. Focus on the **what** and **why**, not the how-to-reproduce.
4. Reference specific line numbers and file paths so entries stay useful as a code reference.
